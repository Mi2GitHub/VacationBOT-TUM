        <p>Hello,
            thank you for being part of my master thesis project. By supporting this study, you help AI developers to create better and more user-focused AI applications in the future.
            You will interact with an artificial intelligence (AI) called VacationBOT. This experimental AI will help you to book a simulated vacation based on your preferences.
            
            Please wait for the study instructor before moving on. Please also don`t use or open the application after the study.

            Thank you very much.

            Sincerly
            Michael Kraus
