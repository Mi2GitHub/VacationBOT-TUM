        <h1>Master Thesis Project</h1>
        <p>Hello, <br/>
            thank you for being part of my master thesis project. By supporting this study, you help AI developers to create better and more user-focused AI applications in the future. <br/>
            You will interact with an artificial intelligence (AI) called VacationBOT. This experimental AI will help you to book a simulated vacation based on your preferences. <br/>
            <br/>
            Please wait for the study instructor before moving on. Please also don`t use or open the application after the study.<br/>
            <br/>
            Thank you very much.<br/>
            <br/>
            Sincerly<br/>
            Michael Kraus
